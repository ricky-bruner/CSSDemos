# CSS Demos
This Repo features modified code from the Udemy Course: 

[Next Level CSS Creative Hover & Animation Effects](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-hover-animation-effects-from-beginners-to-expert/)

Currently, in my career I work extensively in back-end code, primarily C#/.NET, writing server-side console based applications. I've always enjoyed front-end code, particularly styling things and challenging my creative side.

I came across a few youtube videos that led me to this course, and I decided to take it and record my progress here.

## Whats changed?
Rather than hard-coding a ton of HTML and making numerous repos/projects, I setup a structure with this project that would allow all of the Demos to be contained in one place here. The page is basic, has a menu at the top where each demo features a button. Clicking the button activated the CSS Demo and presents the classes/structure for taking if you are in need!

I used `javascript` to handle the html building and the Demo exchanging. Very little js is actually required to achieve any of these demos, with the primary exception being the Fluid Simulation code. Per the course, I had to copy in `dat.gui.min.js` and `fluidSimulation.js` to make that demo a reality. I had to alter the code for fluidSimulation to fit into the my pages format, but have documented these in the files.

Please enjoy the [demos](https://ricky-bruner.github.io/CSSDemos/)!
